# Library-Project
A university book library system featuring librarian interface and user interface
Started with doing the classes needed for the user interface: 
-Jana: Book class, The interface User_Procedures, The interface Librarian_Procedures.
-Rick: Person class, Librarian class, User class, 
We both worked together on the librarian class, specifically the methods in order to make sure that all classes are working simultaneously. Working on these classes was easy most of the time, a little difficulty in Add user and searching but we worked it out
II- UI layout
We thought of doing something similar to logging in on social media where you have a welcome message, a label asking you to log in, then 2 buttons depending on if you’re a user or a librarian
III- Logging in
If you click on Librarian: it opens a login panel where you will be prompted to write your employee ID, it will go on and on until a valid Integer is entered granting you access to a functions panel, accompanied by a logout button.
The librarian methods panel contains 9 methods:
 ▪AddLibrarian
▪ AddUser
▪ Check_Information
▪ SearchBookByTitle
▪ SearchBookByAuthor 
▪ SearchBookByGenre
▪ BorrowBook
▪ ReturnBook
▪ ReserveBook 
Upon pressing each, it opens a new panel on top of the functions each having different purposes and outputs
If you click on User: it opens a login panel where you will be prompted to write your Library card number, it will go on and on until a valid Integer is entered granting you access to a functions panel, accompanied by a logout button.
The user methods panel contains 7  methods:
▪ Check_Information
▪ SearchBookByTitle
▪ SearchBookByAuthor 
▪ SearchBookByGenre
 ▪ BorrowBook
 ▪ ReturnBook
▪ ReserveBook 
Upon pressing each, it opens a new panel on top of the functions each having different purposes and outputs, and of course the logout button that will bring you back on the login page
